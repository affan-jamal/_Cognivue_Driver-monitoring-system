# Driver Monitoring System (DMS)

The Driver Monitoring System (DMS) is designed to enhance road safety by detecting driver drowsiness and distractions in real-time. Utilizing computer vision and deep learning techniques, the system monitors the driver's facial features and actions to identify signs of fatigue or unsafe behaviors.

## Objectives

- Detect driver drowsiness and alertness.
- Identify actions such as yawning and phone usage.
- Provide real-time alerts to prevent accidents.

## Key Components

1. **Video Capture**: Uses a camera to capture live video of the driver.
2. **Facial Detection and Tracking**: Employs Mediapipe for facial landmark detection.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Analyzes eye and mouth landmarks to compute aspect ratios.
4. **Action Detection**: Utilizes pre-trained CNN models to detect specific driver actions.
5. **Alert Mechanism**: Generates audible alerts for detected drowsiness or distractions.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV**: For video capture and processing.
- **Mediapipe**: For facial detection and tracking.
- **TensorFlow**: For deep learning model implementation.
- **Pygame**: For generating alert sounds.
